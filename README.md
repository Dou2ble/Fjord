</a> <br>

A code only game engine i'm writing in C# to make game development easier.

## Release Builds Not Updated

The release builds of Fjord will not be updated from 1.2 for atleast a short while as the engine changes so much currently and it gets so many bug fixes and new features that it's not viable to release a update. The master branch is tested and should be stable enough to support a game and if you have any issues then please report them so i can fix them.

## Tested Platforms

- Windows 10, 11
- Ubuntu 20.04
- macOS Monterey (Intel Chip)

## Usage

Help with the engine can be found at [the wiki](https://github.com/willmexe/Fjord/wiki).
